# Web Component Snippets

This is a collection of snippets for Native Web Components. Not using a framework and is based on the [Custom Element Starter](https://github.com/LuceStudio/custom-elements-starter) by Luce Studio.
The snippets are not limited to that starter, but work very well with it.

## Included snippets:

- `class web component`: Gives a boilerplate web component using `buildShadowRoot` as an implamentation for the web components polyfills.
- `get attribute with value`: Getter and setter that has attribute values.
- `get attribute no value`: Getter and setter based on the existance of an attribute.
- `watchChildren mutation observer`: for adding a mutation observer to bring light dom elements into the shadow dom. Think option element inside a select for your custom element.
